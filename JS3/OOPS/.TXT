OOP:object oriented programmin: we oops to solve realworld problems using object
to create object we need class
class= class is template /datatype to construct object that contains properties and methods
* In javascript we cant print the address of the object so we give the reference variable/object
* we use 'new'keyword to construct object
*variable-property
*function-methods
class-property+methods
class

example to create class


var eid=101;                     class employee{
                                       eid=101;
                                       get_Details{

                                       }
}                                     
 function get_Details(){              }

}

 >> we use object to access class members from the outside 
 >> we use 'this' keyword to access class members inside the class
